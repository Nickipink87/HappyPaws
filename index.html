        Welcome to Happy Paws Secure Dog Field Website
        Here at happy Paws we understand how hard and stressful it can be to exercise dogs in public.
        Maybe you need to safely work on training and recall without distractions.
        Maybe you'd like to have a safe space for your dog to play without reacting to off lead dogs invading their space.
        Maybe you need a safe space to exercise a dog recovering from an illness or injury.
        Whatever the reason we provide a 6ft fenced secure field for timed slots which allow you to have your own safe playtime with no interference.
        Every dog deserves to have fun running off the lead while feeling safe.
